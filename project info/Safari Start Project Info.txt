Outside of class meeting time options:

Other zoom times. E.g. thursday 5pm or weekends
Project Info:

LMS website for supplemental tutorials and practice for the BECE and WASSCE
Gamified experience
Something similar to duolingo or quizlet
Streaks
Web app that works on both Android and iOS devices - instead of a physical app.
AI for reviewing essays
Openai API
Gemini
Deep seek
Other seamless AI integrations?
Payment system placeholder (but we do not need to set it up)
Offline functionality for students in rural/remote communities with limited connectivity
Multiple formats for material to be accessed/uploaded


Notes on Customer Presentation:
Q: format of the educational materials
Learning content: combination of video and written information
Video of him, infographic, avatar video
Practice exercises: (on 2 scales)
Exercise 1 -> Exercise 2 if you score well on #1 
If you think you need additional learning exercises, it would be a paid subscription 
User fee, entry-level (low $) -> get content, learn from it, do practice exercises -> can pay for additional exercises
What about if we did it so students can pay and study individually or they can enter a unique code to be assigned to a teacher so the teacher can see their progress and assign them additional materials
Q: teacher/student/parent roles. Ex. do we want the teacher to be connected to students so the students can submit essays for the teacher to review?
Can teachers create content?
Yes, he wants them to be able to create content themselves
If it’s feasible and doesn’t interfere 
There will be additional content creators for other subjects 
Student submits essay to the system, which is graded by the trained AI (he has already put the exam prompts, examiner reports in chatgpt)
1-9 (9 means fail)
Student submits, chatgpt grades (based on a rubric), human reviews the chatgpt feedback (paid examiners to review the essays)
Content of the educational material:
English language: how to write essays
English literature: how to read, interpret english literature books
Wants to expand to math, chemistry, biology eventually
Video lessons on a website
Wants: Operational, culturally appropriate LMS website
Culturally appropriate: ex. Using coconut icons instead of ice cream 
Wants a site similar to canvas
No assistance from a teacher, and students can get the practice/study material they need
Teachers can use the website to register a class, give students exercises, grade assignments, give feedback
2 age ranges: 
Junior school students take the BECE
Elementary school -> middle school (13/14)
Exam takes place in june 
Seniors in high school take the WASSCE
High school -> college (17/18)

Initial ideas:
Homepage with different roles (student, teachers, parents)
Administrator page so he can edit questions, add new content
Teachers can make a class (unique code)
Can add deadlines/due dates, assign things
AI integration at the end
Make the whole thing gamified 



Backend Design




Frontend Design
UI:





UX:
Chase map to track exercise progress 
Accessibility features (e.g font size, dark mode etc.)
Restricted access points (paid vs free, parent (view mode),  teacher (assign & grade)  student (access material and save changes as they edit)






NOTES FROM DR. HOLLIST
Sierra Leone (University of Sierra Leone)
English how to write essays
How to read and interpret english literature
Dream is to have it expand to more subjects (math, bio, chem)
English speaking west african countries
Tiktok style lessons?
Operational, Culturally Appropriate LMS application
Site like Canvas
Students can access tutorials along with practice
Teachers can access (similar to how teachers use it here at UTampa), register classes, upload classes, and  upload information
There are competitor sites/apps
Two age ranges 
Junior School Students who take BECE to move from elementary to middle school
13 - 14 yo
WASSCE exam is to move from high school into college (2yr, 4yr, Vocational)
17 - 18 yo
Learning content is videos, written pieces, and infographics
Practice content is exam style
Complete 1 and score well, move to next
Paid Subscription would include additional materials that are then turned into a gamefied experience
GAME IS ONLY FOR PAID SUBSCRIPTION
Allow other people to create and upload content to the site
UPLOAD FEATURE
Content is intended to be for the two exams
Dr. Hollist has a trained AI model that will help grade the student's input AI
Also wants teachers to be able to grade submitted work
Functionality to write notes on the rubric
RUBRIC FUNCTIONALITY
Big goal is to retain student attention






Technologies to Research:
Next or Express for backend? 
Next is react but lets you write the backend as you’re doing frontend
React for frontend? 

Final: use Next with React 

Database: Supabase (easier to troubleshoot) 
Built in authentication 
Or building our own? 

Tailwind CSS

Deploy using Vercel



Pipeline of Learning

HTML
Basic Tags (heading, paragraphs, images, href)
Divs
LEARN TAGS
30 minutes

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
This is the way you style a website
You can style specific tags that appear in HTML
1 hour for the basics
You will never master
It will never work right
Ask ChatGPT for help

JavaScript Basics
Watch a crash course
Syntax & Basics
2 hours

ReactJS
Components, Hooks, Props?
How it works
Watch a crash course

NextJS
Watch a crash course
This is just a framework that enhances React
If you understand React you can use NextJS its just a new structure

TailwindCSS
This is super basic if you understand CSS you should understand this fast
Basically rather than writing separate CSS files you can just write it in line
Watch a crash course should be 15 minutes max

Supabase
This is our backend essentially
It gives us basic functionality to implement user authentication (login / signout, etc)
It gives us basic functionality for a database
I would attempt to understand how a database works kind of
The syntax is easy and you can just depend on Supabase Documentation mostly




UML: Universal Modeling Language
Set of diagrams that are useful for capturing and communicating software designs
Two categories of diagrams:
Structural diagrams capture logical structure of the system
Behavioral diagrams capture behaviors/uses of the system
