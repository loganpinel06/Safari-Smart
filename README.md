## Development Notes:
### WHAT TO DO ON FIRST PULL
(ONLY NEEDED FOR FIRST TIME WE SETUP THE CODE BASE ON EVERYONES COMPUTER) <br>
(PLEASE ASK LOGAN FOR HELP IF NEEDED) <br>
When you first pull the code base to your own computer you will be missing some local files that are not included on github due to our `.gitignore` file <br>
Please run the following commands after pulling repo FOR THE FIRST TIME to insure your local code base is setup properly. <br>
`cd next-app` <br>
`npm install`

### Running Next.js Application
We are storing all code related files/directories within its own directory called `/next-app` <br>
When you need to run the application type into terminal: <br>
`cd next-app` <br>
`npm run dev`
